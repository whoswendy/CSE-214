To whomever is reading this,

1.My solution to question1 is is found in the folder Hw5 in folder Question1
named Question1.java. To use the text test file one would have to insert 
the location of the test file into the line that says:
Scanner input = new Scanner(new File("in1.txt")); 
I have made a comment on that line for reference.
The program only works if the text file is in the format that was
described in the the homework6 pdf.
After one run the program, the outputs, number of paths possible in each case, is printed
in the console.

Thank you for taking the time to read this,
Wendy Hu
