To whomever is reading this,
1. My solution to question 1 can be found in the folder named HW3, in the folder named Question1 the file Question1.java. 
The binary tree that i used in my solution to question1 is also found in the folder, Question1.
There is a problem to my output as I do not know why my insert function is incorrect.
The input to question1 has to be inputted in the console. When asked in the console to input please
input the correct input. When asked to input the value of the nodes please input each number with a single
space in between each num ex: 1 2 10 5
After inputting the values the program will output a number that's supposed to be the number of swaps
needed to change a binary tree into a binary search tree, though there might be an error in the output.

2. My solution to question 2 can be found in the folder named HW3, in the folder named Question2, the file Question2.java.
The heap that I used in my solution to question2 is also found in the folder, Question2.
Please enter the input to question2 in the console when prompted. The first input should be the 
number of seating rows, M and number of fans, N with a space in between the two numbers
The second input should be the number of seats in each row with a space in between each number ex:1 3 4
After inputting the values the output will be the total cost of the seats purchased in format of
"Total cost = num"

Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a nice day,
