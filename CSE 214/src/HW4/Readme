To whomever is reading this,
1. My solution to question 1 can be found in the folder HW4, folder titled Question1
file Question1.java
The input to this question has to be inputted in the console. The first line has
to be in the format int1 space int2 , where int1 is the size of the array 
and int2 is the target. After clicking enter please input the numbers in the array
with a single space between each number ex:
line 1 = 4 9
line 2 = 2 7 22 25 (a space separating each integer)
After clicking enter, the output should be outputted.

2.My solution to question 2 can be found in the folder HW4, folder titled Question2
the file Question2.java I created an object called SumSet to store the numbers
that add up to a multiple of the target number. The SumSet class is named SumSet.java
in the same folder.
The input to this question has to be inputted in the console. The first line
has to be in the format int1 space int2, where int1 is the size of the array
and int2 is the mythical number. After clicking enter, please input the numbers
in the array with a single space between each number ex:
line 1 = 10 5
line 2 = 1 10 4 3 2 5 0 1 9 5 (a space between each number)
After clicking enter the output should be outputted. However, I am having a problem
getting the correct output for inputs with duplicated values....

Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a good day,
