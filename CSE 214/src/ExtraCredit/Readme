To whomever is reading this,

The solution to the extra credit question can be found in the folder ExtraCredit, 
titled Homework.java and Graph.java. To run the program please
input the test case text file in the line:
Scanner input = new Scanner(new File("in1.txt"));
I have also made a comment on the line for reference.
The format of the test case text file must strictly follow what was mentioned
in the extra credit pdf. There must only be one space between each number
in the input matrix and no spaces following the last number on each row.
If there are extra spaces there would be a runtime error, so sorry for the
inconvenience. Then the output would be outputted in the console.
The code for the solution of finding the shortest path could be found in the 
file Graph.java.

Thank you for reading this and thank you for your work this past semester,
Wendy Hu
