To whomever is reading this please read carefully...

1. The answer to question1 can be found in the folder named HW2, in the folder Question1 titled Question1.java
The LinkedList that I used to implement Question1 can be found in the folder, HW2 and the linkedlist is titled LinkedList.java
To use the text test file one would have to insert the location of the test file into the line that says
Scanner input = new Scanner(new File("in1.txt")); I have made a comment on that line for reference.
In Question1.java the program would work with the text test files under the assumption that there is no space 
between the first test case and the second, for example:
1 (Test case 1)
10 3
a b c d e f g h i j
10 2 4 5 7 3 2 9 11 6
2 (Test case 2 no space between)
I am having a problem with question1 as the program works in giving an output but
gives the wrong output from each "bucket"
Sorry for the inconvenience.

2. The answer to question2 can be found in the folder named HW2, in the folder Question2 titled Question2.java
The LinkedList that I used to implement Question2 is also found in the folder HW2, titled LinkedList.java 
To use the text test file one would have to insert the location of the test file into the line that says
Scanner input = new Scanner(new File("in2.txt")); I have made a comment on that line for reference.
Question2 would only work with the test case text file assuming that there is no space between the first test
case and the second test case for example: 
1 (Test case 1)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
177 175 165 172 161 170 164
2 (Test case 2 no space between them)
Sorry for the inconvenience.

3. The solution to question3 can be found in the folder named HW2, in the folder Question3 titled Quetion3.java
To use the text test file one would have to insert the location of the test file into the line that says
Scanner input = new Scanner(new File("in3.txt")); I have made a comment on that line for reference.
In Question3.java the program takes input from the text test file, then creates a leakystack and pushes
all the "operations" in the test case into the leaky stack, using a forloop.
As I wasn't sure to what data type will be inputed "op_one" I assumed that the input 
type would be string. So, the leakystack right now could only deal with strings.
The LeakyStack class can be found in folder HW2, Question3, titled LeakyStack.java
As to test our question3 the program will only work if the test file has no space between each cases 
for example:
1 (testcase 1)
3
op_one op_two op_three op_four op_five
2 (testcase 2 no space)
Sorry for the inconvenience.

4. The solution to question4 can be found in the folder HW2, Question4, titled Question4.java. The ListQueue that was used in question4
can be found in the folder HW2, titled ListQueue.java
To use the text test file one would have to insert the location of the test file into the line that says
Scanner input = new Scanner(new File("in4.txt")); I have made a comment on that line for reference.
In Question4.java the program would only work with the test case text file assuming that there is no space between the first test
case and the second test case for example:
1 (Testcase 1)
6 5
1 2 2 3 4 5
2 (Testcase 2 no space between)
The program does not give the correct output 
Sorry for the inconvenience.


Thank you for reading through this and have a nice day,
